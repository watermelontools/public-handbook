# Strategy

**Watermelon is an Open Source Copilot For Code Review**. Our GitHub application allows developers to pre-review GitHub Pull Requests by tracing their code context and performing static code analysis. Using LLMs to detect errors, compare intent to implementation, and give the PR a first health check.

Our much more bigger vision is to build a copilot for engineering leaders. 

Openness is one of our values. We think that a company should be as open as possible. Not just the code, but also its strategy and its know-how. 

## Product
For large software engineering teams that spend a lot of time on code reviews, we provide a CI/CD app to expedite and contextualize the code review process. 

Developers spend 30% of their time doing code review. Despite that, code that doesn't satisfy the business requirements still gets deployed to production. Non-technical stakeholders can help with this (product managers and designers), but 50% of them claim that the code review process it too technical and complex for them. There is a gap in the world. 

We want to fill this gap and that's why we've built a GitHub application to expedite and contextualize the code review process. Our product pre-reviews PRs by comparing intent to implementation, and by running static code analysis to detect errors. All of this by tracing code context relevant to the PR being analyzed. 

## Business Model
Our product is source-available. As developers ourselves we understand this: We simply prefer to install products that are open instead of those that are closed. 

Right now we're in the process of experimenting with different price points. 

## Go-to-market
- Marketplaces of existing platforms (currenlty the GitHub marketplace and the GitLab and Atlassian marketplaces in the future)
- Content marketing (posting educational content for devs on Hacker News, Reddit, Hashnode, etc. aka. Technical writing)
- SEO (as we keep doing content marketing, we increase our Domain Authority which correlates to organic traffic).
- Engineering as marketing (our IDE extensions)
