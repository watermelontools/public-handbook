# Strategy

**Watermelon is a Passive Documentation Search Engine** serving both our GitHub app and IDE extension. Our set of plug-ins help developers understand code context, improve their coding velocity and merge PRs like a breeze.

Our much more bigger vision is to build a copilot for engineering leaders. 

Openness is one of our values. We think that a company should be as open as possible. Not just the code, but also its strategy and its know-how. 

## Product
Our passive documentation search engine tailors to both individual contributors and engineering leaders (teams). 

Our IDE extension is our individual contributor-oriented product. Our philosophy is to provide individuals a 100% free and open-source product. 

Our GitHub application is our engineering leader-oriented product. We're charging for unlimited use for this product and its proprietary features, while still making this codebase source-available. 

## Business Model
We are an open-core startup. What this means is that we have a dual licensing strategy as described above. As developers ourselves we understand this: We simply prefer to install products that are open instead of those that are closed. 

Right now we're in the process of experimenting with different price points. 

## Go-to-market
IDE extension
- Marketplaces of existing platforms (IDE marketplaces)
- Content marketing (posting educational content for devs on Hacker News, Reddit, Hashnode, etc. aka. Technical writing)
- SEO (as we keep doing content marketing, we increase our Domain Authority which correlates to organic traffic).

CI/CD app
- Same strategy as the IDE extension
- We're also figuring out a UX that will convert IDE users into CI/CD users.
