# Strategy

**Watermelon is an Open Source Copilot For Code Review**. Our GitHub application allows developers to pre-review GitHub Pull Requests by tracing their code context and performing static code analysis. Using LLMs to detect errors, compare intent to implementation, and give the PR a first health check.

Our much more bigger vision is to build a copilot for engineering leaders. 

Openness is one of our values. We think that a company should be as open as possible. Not just the code, but also its strategy and its know-how. 

## Product
For large software engineering teams that spend a lot of time on code reviews, we provide a CI/CD app to expedite and contextualize the code review process. 

Developers spend 30% of their time doing code review. Despite that, code that doesn't satisfy the business requirements still gets deployed to production. Non-technical stakeholders can help with this (product managers and designers), but 50% of them claim that the code review process it too technical and complex for them. There is a gap in the world. 

We want to fill this gap and that's why we've built a GitHub application to expedite and contextualize the code review process. Our product pre-reviews PRs by comparing intent to implementation, and by running static code analysis to detect errors. All of this by tracing code context relevant to the PR being analyzed. 

## Business Model
We want to be as open as possible while still ensuring the long-term profitability of our business. This likely points to an "open core" approach, where some features are open-source and others are proprietary but available to view in the source.

As for when these components will be publicly available, we're still figuring that out. Currently, we're testing different pricing models by making the entire repository available under an Apache License with a Commons Clause. But above all, our main, short-term focus is on delivering the best product possible.

## Go-to-market
- Marketplaces of existing platforms (currenlty the GitHub marketplace and the GitLab and Atlassian marketplaces in the future)
- Content marketing (posting educational content for devs on Hacker News, Reddit, Hashnode, etc. aka. Technical writing)
- SEO (as we keep doing content marketing, we increase our Domain Authority which correlates to organic traffic).
- Tech conferences and webinars.
- Engineering as marketing (our IDE extensions)
- We are also running experiments with paid ads, social media videos, and cold-emailing.
