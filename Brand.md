# Brand Guidelines

1. Our primary domain is watermelontools.com, always prefer to link to that one over watermelon.tools (which redirects to the former)
2. Our brand's personality sounds spicy and controversial, while still being informative about some software engineering topic
3. Watermelon's color palette is:
   - Primary red: #db6161
   - Primary green: #75b855
   - Secondary red: #ad3838
   - Secondary green: #157241
4. We like emojis, in fact our name is an emoji üçâ
