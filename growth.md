# Growth
Growth is a multimodal, very brittle thing. Every time we start focusing on something, all the other channels suffer, but ultimately, making the company grow is one of the main target of the whole organization.

We could think growth as a series of different metrics, but we focus on bringing in new users, expansion of use and brand awareness only. Our main goal is to get poeple to install the GitHub App and use it by sending PRs and updating them.

## New Users

For new users, we need to signup the whole team.

This is honestly a very hard task, so we decided to focus on the managers, because, usually, they hold the power of decision, credit card and admin priviledges for repos.

For this task we will get into their top of mind with more long form content such as blog posts, and will use their preferred social networks such as LinkedIn.

## Expansion of Use

Once we've managed to get the users to install, we need to get them addicted to the product. Regardless of how we charge the organization (per API call, packages of several uses, per seat...), we want them to expect the app on every PR.
