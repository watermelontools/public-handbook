# Videos

We use a video strategy to push the blog posts. They are not yet independent content.

## Recording
Use good quality equipment, a good mic, a quiet space or moment. 
Be original and make it natural.
Try to stay under 1 minute.

## Editing
We use [veed.io](https://www.veed.io) to edit the video, it automatically adds subitles and allows you to crop.

## Posting
Always add the link to the referred blog, usually as the first comment.
We like to post on:
 - LinkedIn
 - TikTok
 - 𝕏 (formerly Twitter)
 - Reddit
 - Youtube Shorts
 - Any other you can think of (and add to this list!)
