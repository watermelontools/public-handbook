## Working during the weeekends, and extra hours
We usually leave work around 6PM to spend time with friends and family. We know that having healthy relationships with your loved ones is important. 

However, as an early stage startup we don't want to hide a reality: Raw hours make a big difference for us right now. Because of this, we sometimes find ourselves working later on the evening, during the weekend, or during a holiday, but it's mostly driven by personal ambition. We don't have any expectations of anyone to do so. 

## Holidays, vacations and days off
Everyone at the company is free to take vacations when they want and to observe the holidays of the country they are currently living in. If they want to take some other day off, people are free to do so as well.

To achieve this, we have the concept of permissionless days off. You have the right to take 25 days off throughout the year. All you have to do, is tell your team that you're gonna be off that day so that they have time to prepare for your absence. These days can either be separated, or together.

You also have 5 days for sickness. We need you to be at your 100% when producing input. If you don't use these days, they can be used as extra days off. 

## Benefits
You get USD $140 a month to get your workspace setup, and this means anything that improves it: a coworking, plants, paying for your internet, a tablet... We can negotiate a lot on this.  

You may also collect a few months and make a big expense after a while, maybe a huge monitor, or painting a room.

## Time
We default to 24H times, unless otherwise stated. If you choose a 12H system, be clear, using AM and PM.
Take advantage of the calendar system to transform time.

## Cards 
We may issue cards to certain employees, these are personal as we keep track of expenses this way.
