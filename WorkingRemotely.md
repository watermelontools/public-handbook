# Working Remotely

Work from wherever, but work. That's our motto. Despite starting out as a hybrid company, since day 0 we've had the vision of being a globally descentralized workforce. 

Starting in October 2022, we will become a fully remote, asynchronous company. To do so, we have this manifesto:

- We allow people to live and work from all over the globe, instead of a central location. 
- We have flexible hours over fixed hours.
- We default to writing down knowledge, over defaulting to Slack and/or Zoom calls.
- We share information publicly (company-wide).
- We allow everyone to propose changes to docs (like this one), and encourage comments from all.
- We value asynchronous communication over synchronous communication.

The main benefit of being a 100% remote company  is that we can hire the best person in the world for a given role. Lifestyle flexibility, saving real estate costs, and being a multi-cultural company are the icing on the cake. 

However, this philosophy isn't perfect. It comes with caveats. 

- Lack of information osmosis: It's the whole reason why we decided to start this company. We want to improve information osmosis for engineering teams. To help address the problem (both for engineering and non-engineering roles) we also have our manifesto of defaulting to writing down knowledge. 
- Lack of team cohesion: Playing board games online is the best way we've found to address this point. Tools such as Donut can also help us as we get new team cohesion challenges as we scale. However, the best answer we have to this is getting together a few weeks per year. Read the Watermelon Onsite section below. 

And some responsibilites: 
- You are required to have a stable internet connection that allows your work to be comfortable. This means video-calls should work without issue, but if at a given moment they don't, you will be required to upgrade your internet connection, and if this is not possible, you are required to relocate at your own expense.
- You must make an effort to keep your work items protected. We will replace a stolen computer the first time this occurs, but not the second time and beyond. Please be extra careful if you are in a remote place, as replacing something as simple as a charger could be difficult.
