# Developing Software as a Team

We operate with a flexible gitflow methodology. What this means is
- We create Pull Requests
- We highly encourage PR review from any new branch to dev. We understand it's not mandatory because we know that we have to do many non-development tasks as a company, but it's highly encouraged.
- The PR creator is, in general, who should merge, but in case another person needs the change and knows the task is finished, they can merge. The responsibility of breaking changes comes with the mering action, be careful.
- Reviewing merging dev to main is mandatory.
  
Once we have an engineering team (team could be defined as CTO + founding engineer), we go back to strict gitflow.
