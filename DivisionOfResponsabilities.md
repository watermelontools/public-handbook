## Division of responsibilities
The functions of the growth team are growth marketing, B2B sales, finance, HR, and fundraising. 

The functions of the engineering team are software development and product design.

Someone from the growth team can touch the code, but only for changes that generate immediate impact. Every other change should be handled by the engineering team. 

The product management function won't be done by a product manager but by everyone on the team by distributing responsibilities. This is because we are an engineering and design-driven organization.
