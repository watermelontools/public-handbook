## Access to Company Data
- Employees should get read only access to Azure
- Growth team members should have full access to webflow. If someone from another team requests it, we'll accept it.
- app.watermelontools.com (Vercel) should have full access from engineering to make all the changes they want

There are 2 kinds of monthly company updates: The ones that are public to the team, and the ones that are public to the entire world.
 
Team company updates include data about cash, and are distributed both to current investors and team members. 

Public company updates contain the same data, but remove data about cash. These are distributed to potential investors and the rest of the world. 

## Accounts
Although things like GitHub might have several different emails, we prefer using the work account for everything. Please refrain from using personal accounts.
